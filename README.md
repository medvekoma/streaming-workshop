# Spark Structured Streaming Workshop

This repository contains a few Structured Streaming exercises
that can be used to learn the concepts of Spark Structured Streaming.

## Prerequisites

The code examples can be executed on a machine that has the following components pre-installed:
* `spark-shell`: The command-line interface to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).
* `nc`: Netcat, used for sending TCP messages to a specified port. Pre-installed on Linux-based systems.

Both are installed to the virtual machine provided.

## Repository contents

The repository contains the following folders:
* [demo](demo): Contains examples that can be executed in the terminal window.
* [src](src): Contains one code example that can be executed from an IDE. 

For understanding the concepts, the [demo](demo) folder is enough. Only use the [src](src)
folder if you have a working IDE, and want to play more freely with the code.
